## Scratch Effect

### Project Description:

The **Scratch Effect** project showcases an engaging and interactive webpage where users can reveal an underlying image by "scratching" the surface with their cursor. This effect mimics the experience of scratching a surface to uncover hidden content, providing a playful and engaging user interaction. The project is developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

### Key Features:

1. **Interactive Scratch Effect:**
   - The webpage initially displays a patterned overlay, obscuring the image beneath.
   - Users can "scratch" the overlay using their cursor, revealing the hidden image in real-time as they move the cursor over the surface.

2. **Customizable Overlay and Image:**
   - The overlay pattern and the image can be customized to fit different themes or purposes, making this effect versatile for various applications such as games, promotions, or interactive art.

3. **Responsive Design:**
   - The scratch effect is designed to work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience for all users.

4. **Smooth and Realistic Interaction:**
   - JavaScript is utilized to track the cursor's position and dynamically update the visible areas, providing a smooth and realistic scratching experience.
   - CSS is used to style the overlay and the underlying image, creating a visually appealing contrast between the covered and revealed areas.

5. **Engagement and Gamification:**
   - This project enhances user engagement by offering a hands-on and fun way to explore content. It can be used in marketing campaigns to unveil surprises or in educational contexts to make learning more interactive.

6. **Accessibility Considerations:**
   - The project includes considerations for accessibility, ensuring that users who may not be able to use a cursor can still engage with the content through alternative input methods.

### Technologies Used:

- **HTML5:** Structure and layout of the webpage.
- **CSS3:** Styling for the overlay pattern and the image, as well as handling visual transitions.
- **JavaScript:** Core logic for the scratch effect, tracking cursor movement, and updating the revealed areas dynamically.

### Outcome:

The Scratch Effect project demonstrates creative use of web technologies to create an interactive and engaging experience. This project highlights my skills in front-end development, particularly in creating unique and user-friendly interfaces that encourage exploration and interaction.
